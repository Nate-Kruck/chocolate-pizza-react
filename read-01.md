1. Nesting Templates

## Getting literal with ES6 Template Strings

1. String Substitution
    * This allows us to take any valid JS expression and inside a Template Literal, the result will be output as part of the same string. Template Strings introduce a completely different way of solving these problems.
    * Multi Line template literals by adding a new line into the string as we write it.
