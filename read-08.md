# SQL Practice

1. SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

1. By learning SQL, the goal is to learn how to answer specific questions about this data, like "What types of vehicles are on the road have less than four wheels?", or "How many models of cars does Tesla produce?", to help us make better decisions down the road.

1. To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.

1. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned. It has a specific syntax though, which is what we are going to learn in the following exercises.

1. In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query.

1. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

1. More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous AND or OR logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2).

1. In addition to making the results more manageable to understand, writing clauses to constrain the set of rows returned also allows the query to run faster due to the reduction in unnecessary data being returned.

1. When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching.

1. Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be â€“ take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year. In such cases, SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the DISTINCT keyword.

1. Since the DISTINCT keyword will blindly remove duplicate rows, we will learn in a future lesson how to discard duplicates based on specific columns using grouping and the GROUP BY clause.

1. When an ORDER BY clause is specified, each row is sorted alpha-numerically based on the specified column's value. In some databases, you can also specify a collation to better sort data containing international text.

1. Another clause which is commonly used with the ORDER BY clause are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about. The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.

1. In SQL, the database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain. This fixed structure is what allows a database to be efficient, and consistent despite storing millions or even billions of rows.

1. When inserting data into a database, we need to use an INSERT statement, which declares which table to write into, the columns of data that we are filling, and one or more rows of data to insert.

1. In addition to adding new data, a common task is to update existing data, which can be done using an UPDATE statement. Similar to the INSERT statement, you have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update. In addition, the data you are updating has to match the data type of the columns in the table schema.

1. The statement works by taking multiple column/value pairs, and applying those changes to each and every row that satisfies the constraint in the WHERE clause.

1. Most people working with SQL will make mistakes updating data at one point or another. Whether it's updating the wrong set of rows in a production database, or accidentally leaving out the WHERE clause (which causes the update to apply to all rows), you need to be extra careful when constructing UPDATE statements.

1. One helpful tip is to always write the constraint first and test it in a SELECT query to make sure you are updating the right rows, and only then writing the column/value pairs to update.

1. When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a DELETE statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause.

1. If you decide to leave out the WHERE constraint, then all rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional).

1. When you have new entities and relationships to store in your database, you can create a new database table using the CREATE TABLE statement.

1. As your data changes over time, SQL provides a way for you to update your corresponding tables and database schemas by using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

1. The syntax for adding a new column is similar to the syntax when creating new rows in the CREATE TABLE statement. You need to specify the data type of the column along with any potential table constraints and default values to be applied to both existing and new rows. In some databases like MySQL, you can even specify where to insert the new column using the FIRST or AFTER clauses, though this is not a standard feature.

1. Dropping columns is as easy as specifying the column to drop, however, some databases (including SQLite) don't support this feature. Instead you may have to create a new table and migrate the data over.

1. If you need to rename the table itself, you can also do that using the RENAME TO clause of the statement.

1. In some rare cases, you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, and to do so, you can use the DROP TABLE statement, which differs from the DELETE statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.

1. Like the CREATE TABLE statement, the database may throw an error if the specified table does not exist, and to suppress that error, you can use the IF EXISTS clause.
