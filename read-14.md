# Project Ideas & API's

- For the upcoming project I would like to create something that uses food/drink or sports related API's.

1. I would like to use a food/drink API to locate local coffee shops (even the hidden gems) and present them to the user along with a brief description, photo and rating.

1. For the sports related API, I think it would be challenging, yet fun, to create a fantasy football app that ranks players, gives team news and allows the user to create their own custom roster.

- The user can add/remove players to their team as the season progresses, the user will also receive updates on every player they have selected.
